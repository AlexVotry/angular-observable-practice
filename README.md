# Repository Content

This was a tutorial from Angular University [RxJs and Reactive Patterns Angular Architecture Course](https://angular-university.io/course/reactive-angular-architecture-course).

This course repository is updated to Angular v7, there is a Yarn lock file available.

Experiments with observable and Rxjs. 

I worked with observables directly between components and services. 
I created observables to make api calls to a separate server on localhost.  
In the course component I used two services as providers exclusively for the course component to allow two instances of the course to appear independently of each other.

I added a course-detail resolver to allow for data to appear more seamlessly
